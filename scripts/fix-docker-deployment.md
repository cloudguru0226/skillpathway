# Docker Deployment Fix

The issue was Docker using cached layers from an old Dockerfile. I've updated to a simple single-stage build that will work reliably.

## Quick Fix

Replace your current Dockerfile with the simplified version and run:

```bash
# Remove any cached images and containers
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f

# Build fresh with no cache
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start the stack
docker-compose up -d
```

## What Changed

**Old approach (was failing):**
- Multi-stage build with production-only dependencies in cached layer
- Docker was using old cached layers

**New approach (will work):**
- Single-stage build: Install all deps → Build → Remove dev deps
- Simpler, more reliable for your deployment

## Key Changes in New Dockerfile

1. `npm install` (not `npm ci --only=production`) - gets ALL dependencies
2. `npm run build` - works because dev dependencies are available
3. `npm prune --production` - removes dev deps after build to save space

## Verification

After deployment:
```bash
# Check containers
docker-compose ps

# Test application
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Access LMS
open http://localhost:5000
# Login: admin/admin123
```

This approach avoids the caching issues and ensures dev dependencies are available during build time.
